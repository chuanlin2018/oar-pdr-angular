            When your draft publication is created, it is assigned both an identifier and a name.  The system chooses the identifier, but you get to choose the name.  This name will not appear in the final publication; it is just a name that MIDAS will display in its portal to remind you what this publication is about.

            This name should be brief--say, 16 characters or less (so it should not be the same as the publication title).  If it is much longer than that, it may get truncated in displays. A name must unique among all the records you create; we'll let you know if you are about to enter a name you've assigned before.  If you wish, you can change this name later.
